Very basic and simple package to show different robots.txt files for different environments. Just create new directory
and create there blade files with environment names. That's it!

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require sergeybruhin/dynamic-robots
```

### Publish Config

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="SergeyBruhin\DynamicRobots\Providers\DynamicRobotsServiceProvider"
```


### Set robots blade files directory

If you want to change robots.txt for production environment just add **production.blade.php** with robots.txt content
to **resources/views/robots**.

```php
return [
    /**
     * Custom robots blade files directory prefix without trailing dot
     * eg: robots
     * If empty, default robots.txt from package will be used
     */
    'directory' => 'robots',
];
```


### Create Default robots.txt

If there are no blade file for current environment, default.blade.php will be used. 
So don't forget to create it in **/resources/views/{your-directory}**!

### Default robots.txt from package if user robots.txt not exists

```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/*
Disallow: /nova/*
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have robots.txt in public folder don't forget to delete it!
